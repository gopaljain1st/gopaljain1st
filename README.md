I'm a student of B.Tech(CSE) pre-final year. After a long search, I have found my love to be in Competitive Coding. I spend my free time on Hackerrank to enhance my " Problem Solving " skill. There are lots of platforms, but I love Hackerrank most.
I'm Skilled in these languages C, C++, Core Java, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
I am quite good at Data Structure and Algorithms. I always try to reduce my code "Complexity" and max of the time I achieve it.
I am a little bit good in DBMS and i always focused on it. I love to learn new technologies and always searching for new opportunities to express my ideas.
I am a very kind person. I always believe in karma and I love to help other peoples. I always work hard with full dedication to achieve my goals and I get success up to extend.
